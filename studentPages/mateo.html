      <p>Biases That Are Commonly Associated with Mental Illness</p>
      <h3><i>What's the most important thing you have learned in Science Research?</i></h3>
      <p>Throughout Science Research the most important thing I have learned is how to properly present. Prior to Science Research I struggled a lot with presentations. But Science Research gave me a lot of confidence in my presenting abilities, and taught me much about presentations.</p>

      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>Mental illness is a massive problem facing society today. About 1 in 4 adults suffer from a mental illness, whether diagnosed or not diagnosed. But another problem that is not commonly known about mental illness is stigmas associated with mental illness, and how they affect people with mental illness. Stigmas are feelings commonly associated with something from a bias. This can be a dangerous thing and cause for people suffering mental illness, to become even worse than what they started. This could cause people with mental illness to feel disconnected, and worse than someone without that mental illness.</p>
