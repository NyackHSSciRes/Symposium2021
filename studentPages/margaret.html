      <h3><i>What's the most important thing you have learned in Science Research?</i></h3>
      <p>The most important thing I have learned in Science Research is public speaking and presentation skills. Throughout the class, my presentations have become significantly better, and my public speaking has also improved. These techniques will last me a lifetime.</p>

      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>I am currently studying the effect that global warming has on hurricane intensity and their damage. Global Warming is a huge issue in our society today, and is responsible for many damages to our environment such as worsened air quality, warmer ocean temperatures, and ice caps melting. Scientists know Hurricanes can be caused by these warmer ocean temperatures and rising sea levels, and that these storms tend to be stronger. Scientists have also theorized that the effects of global warming could lead to higher storm surges, wind damage, and rainfall, leading to more deadly damage. The strong hurricane seasons in the past few years, and the large amounts of damage they have caused proves how important it is to study hurricanes for our future.</p>
