      <h3>Project Summary</h3>
      <p>Currently I am studying the effects of ACEs on mental health. Mental health during adolescents  is very important in todayâ€™s society. ACEs occur during a very developmental stage in life that leads it to have many effects on the body and especially the brain.   While it is commonly associated with the development of mental disorders, it is also evident to affect blood pressure. The awareness and coping skills of ACEs are very important since they have such a big impact on the body and brain. Being aware of ACEs and what they can cause is very crucial in the prevention of mental illnesses.</p>
